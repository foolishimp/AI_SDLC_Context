# Development Methodology

## Baseline Practices for AI_SDLC_Context

This directory contains the core development methodology for AI_SDLC_Context, adapted from the [ai_init project](https://github.com/foolishimp/ai_init). These practices form the **foundation** of how we build software.

---

## Quick Start

### The Sacred Seven Principles

1. **Test Driven Development** - "No code without tests"
2. **Fail Fast & Root Cause** - "Break loudly, fix completely"
3. **Modular & Maintainable** - "Single responsibility, loose coupling"
4. **Reuse Before Build** - "Check first, create second"
5. **Open Source First** - "Suggest alternatives, human decides"
6. **No Legacy Baggage** - "Clean slate, no debt"
7. **Perfectionist Excellence** - "Best of breed only"

**Ultimate Mantra**: **"Excellence or nothing"** 🔥

### The TDD Workflow

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → COMMIT → REPEAT
```

## Core Documents

### Principles

#### [The Sacred Seven](principles/SACRED_SEVEN.md)
The seven fundamental principles that govern all development:
- Test Driven Development
- Fail Fast & Root Cause
- Modular & Maintainable
- Reuse Before Build
- Open Source First
- No Legacy Baggage
- Perfectionist Excellence

**When to read**: Before starting any development work

### Processes

#### [TDD Workflow](processes/TDD_WORKFLOW.md)
Complete guide to Test-Driven Development:
- RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle
- Writing effective tests
- Refactoring practices
- Common scenarios
- Anti-patterns to avoid

**When to read**: Daily, during development

---

## Quick Reference

### Before You Code

Ask these questions (from the Sacred Seven):

1. **Have I written tests first?** (Principle #1)
2. **Will this fail loudly if something's wrong?** (Principle #2)
3. **Does this module have a single, clear purpose?** (Principle #3)
4. **Did I check if this already exists?** (Principle #4)
5. **Have I researched alternatives?** (Principle #5)
6. **Am I avoiding technical debt?** (Principle #6)
7. **Is this the best possible implementation?** (Principle #7)

**If you can't answer "yes" to all seven, don't write the code yet.**

### Common Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/ai_sdlc_config --cov-report=html

# Watch mode (TDD)
pytest tests/ --watch

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_hierarchy_merger.py::test_merge_two_hierarchies -v
```

### TDD Cycle

```python
# 1. RED: Write failing test
def test_new_feature():
    result = my_function()
    assert result == expected

# Run: pytest (should FAIL)

# 2. GREEN: Write minimal code
def my_function():
    return expected

# Run: pytest (should PASS)

# 3. REFACTOR: Improve code
def my_function():
    """Well-documented, clean implementation."""
    # Improved code
    return result

# Run: pytest (should still PASS)

# 4. COMMIT
git add tests/ src/
git commit -m "feat: add new feature with tests"
```

## Application to AI_SDLC_Context

### Evidence of Excellence

Our commitment to these principles is demonstrated by:

**Test Coverage**:
- 156 unit tests (100% passing)
- Test execution: 0.16 seconds
- Coverage: Comprehensive

**Test Breakdown**:
- `test_hierarchy_node.py`: 51 tests
- `test_yaml_loader.py`: 28 tests
- `test_uri_resolver.py`: 28 tests
- `test_hierarchy_merger.py`: 31 tests
- `test_config_manager.py`: 18 tests

**Code Quality**:
- Modular design (models, loaders, mergers, core)
- Single responsibility per class
- Comprehensive documentation
- No technical debt

## How to Use This Methodology

### For New Features

1. Read [Sacred Seven](principles/SACRED_SEVEN.md) - Refresh principles
2. Review [TDD Workflow](processes/TDD_WORKFLOW.md) - Understand process
3. Write test first (RED phase)
4. Implement minimally (GREEN phase)
5. Refactor for quality (REFACTOR phase)
6. Commit with clear message
7. Repeat for next test

### For Bug Fixes

1. Write test that reproduces bug (should fail)
2. Fix the bug (test should pass)
3. Add related edge case tests
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit fix

### For Refactoring

1. Ensure all tests pass first
2. Refactor one thing at a time
3. Keep tests passing throughout
4. Commit when done

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] All new code has tests
- [ ] Tests follow RED→GREEN→REFACTOR
- [ ] Code follows Sacred Seven principles
- [ ] No technical debt introduced
- [ ] Documentation is clear
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive

## Philosophy

### Why These Principles?

The Sacred Seven are not arbitrary rules - they're battle-tested practices that:

1. **Reduce bugs** - Tests catch issues early
2. **Improve design** - TDD leads to better architecture
3. **Enable confidence** - Refactor without fear
4. **Accelerate development** - Clear patterns speed up work
5. **Ensure quality** - Excellence is built in, not added later

### From ai_init to AI_SDLC_Context

AI_SDLC_Context inherits and extends the ai_init methodology:

**Inherited**:
- The Sacred Seven principles
- TDD workflow (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR)
- "Excellence or nothing" mindset
- Comprehensive testing practices

**Extended**:
- Applied to configuration management domain
- Adapted for hierarchical data structures
- Integrated with MCP service patterns
- Scaled to 156 tests across 5 modules

---

## Non-Negotiables

These practices are **requirements**, not suggestions:

❌ **Rejected**:
- Code without tests
- Silent error handling
- God classes
- Duplicated functionality
- Undocumented library choices
- Technical debt
- "Good enough" quality

✅ **Required**:
- Tests first
- Loud failures
- Modular design
- Code reuse
- Documented decisions
- Clean implementation
- Excellence
