# Persona-Based Context Management

## ⚠️ Status: Legacy Documentation

**Note**: This document describes the persona system design. Personas are now implemented as hierarchical projects within `example_projects_repo/` rather than standalone YAML files. Personas can be created as projects and loaded as layers in the merge hierarchy.

For current implementation, personas should be structured as AI_SDLC_Context projects with `project.json` and `config/config.yml` files.

---

## Overview

**Personas** add a role-based layer to the context management system, allowing different team members (business analyst, architect, engineer, tester, etc.) to have customized views and overrides of the same project configuration.

## Architecture

### Configuration Layers with Personas

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Persona + Project Context

```python
# Load project context
load_context("payment_gateway")

# Apply persona
load_persona("business_analyst")

# Result: BA view of payment gateway
# - Focuses on requirements and acceptance criteria
# - Hides implementation details
# - Emphasizes business logic
# - Shows relevant documentation
```

### Pattern 2: Switching Personas

```python
# Engineer working on implementation
load_context("payment_gateway")
load_persona("software_engineer")
# → Sees code details, unit tests, technical docs

# Switch to QA for review
switch_persona("software_engineer", "qa_engineer")
# → Sees test coverage, test plans, quality gates
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Persona Collaboration

```python
# Tech lead reviewing architecture
load_context("payment_gateway")
load_persona("tech_lead")
# → Reviews architecture, technical decisions

# Security engineer reviewing security
load_persona("security_engineer")
# → Reviews threat model, security tests, compliance
```

## Example: Claude with Persona Context

### Business Analyst View

```
User: Load payment_gateway context with business_analyst persona

Claude: ✓ Loaded payment_gateway (PCI compliant)
        ✓ Applied business_analyst persona

Context Understanding:
• Focus: Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
• View: Business logic (implementation details hidden)
• Documentation: Narrative style with diagrams

User: Review this payment processing code

Claude: From a business analyst perspective:

Business Logic Analysis:
✓ Meets requirement: Process payment securely
✓ Implements acceptance criteria: Fraud detection
✓ Satisfies business rule: Minimum amount validation

Concerns:
• Missing user story link in comments
• Business logic for refunds not documented
• Need acceptance criteria for edge cases

Recommendation: Add user story references and document
the refund business process before proceeding.
```

### Software Engineer View

```
User: Load payment_gateway context with software_engineer persona

Claude: ✓ Loaded payment_gateway (PCI compliant)
        ✓ Applied software_engineer persona

Context Understanding:
• Focus: Code quality, unit tests, implementation
• View: Full technical details
• Testing: 90% unit coverage, 80% integration

User: Review this payment processing code

Claude: From a software engineer perspective:

Code Quality Analysis:
✓ Clean code principles followed
✓ SOLID principles applied
✓ Proper error handling
⚠ Missing unit tests for edge cases

Technical Issues:
• Function too long (65 lines, max 50)
• Cyclomatic complexity: 12 (max 10)
• Missing type hints on return value

Unit Test Coverage:
• Current: 75% (target: 90%)
• Missing tests: refund scenarios, timeout handling

Recommendation: Refactor into smaller functions, add type
hints, and increase unit test coverage to 90%.
```

### QA Engineer View

```
User: Load payment_gateway context with qa_engineer persona

Claude: ✓ Loaded payment_gateway (PCI compliant)
        ✓ Applied qa_engineer persona

Context Understanding:
• Focus: Test coverage, test automation, quality gates
• View: Test scenarios and edge cases
• Quality: Zero critical bugs required

User: Review this payment processing code

Claude: From a QA engineer perspective:

Test Coverage Analysis:
✓ Happy path covered
✓ Basic error scenarios tested
⚠ Edge cases missing

Missing Test Scenarios:
• Concurrent payment attempts
• Network timeout during processing
• Partial refund scenarios
• Maximum transaction amount
• Expired card scenarios

Test Data Concerns:
• Need test data for international cards
• Missing test data for various merchant types

Recommendation: Create comprehensive test plan covering
all edge cases, add automated tests for regression suite,
ensure 80% automation coverage.

## Summary

**Personas add a crucial role-based layer** to the context management system:

🎭 **What**: Role-specific configuration overrides and preferences
📊 **Where**: Layer 5 (highest priority after runtime)
🎯 **Why**: Different roles need different views of the same project
🔄 **How**: YAML configs that merge with project context

**This enables**:
- Business analyst sees requirements and business logic
- Engineer sees code and technical details
- QA sees test coverage and quality gates
- DevOps sees deployment and infrastructure
- Security sees threats and compliance

**Claude can now act as ANY role on the team!** 🎭🧠
