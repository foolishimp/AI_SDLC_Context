# Full Context State Feature

## Overview

Added comprehensive context state visualization that provides complete transparency into:
- Configuration layer stack
- Merge order and priorities
- Active persona (if applied)
- Complete materialized configuration
- Layer attribution

## What Was Added

### 1. New ContextManager Method

**File**: `mcp_service/server/context_tools.py`

Added `get_full_context_state()` method that returns:
```python
{
    "status": "context_loaded",
    "project_name": "payment_gateway",
    "project_type": "standard",
    "active_layers": [
        {"file": "01_corporate_base.yml", "name": "Corporate Base", ...},
        {"file": "02_methodology_python.yml", "name": "Methodology", ...},
        {"file": "03_project_payment_gateway.yml", "name": "Project-Specific", ...},
        {"file": "persona_override", "name": "Persona: Security Engineer", ...}
    ],
    "layer_count": 4,
    "merge_order": "Corporate Base â†’ Methodology â†’ Project-Specific â†’ Persona",
    "active_persona": {...},
    "materialized_context": {...},
    "policies_loaded": 3,
    "documentation_loaded": 2
}
```

### 2. Human-Readable Formatter

**File**: `mcp_service/server/context_tools.py`

Added `format_full_context_state()` function that creates formatted output:

```
================================================================================
ðŸŽ¯ FULL CONTEXT STATE: payment_gateway
================================================================================

**Project Type**: standard
**Active Layers**: 4

## Configuration Layer Stack

**Merge Order**: Corporate Base â†’ Methodology â†’ Project-Specific â†’ Persona

### Layer 1: Corporate Base
- **File**: `01_corporate_base.yml`
- **Description**: Company-wide standards and policies
- **Path**: `/path/to/projects_repo/payment_gateway/01_corporate_base.yml`

[... more layers ...]

## Active Persona

**Name**: Security Engineer
**Role**: security_engineer
**Focus Areas**:
  - Security testing
  - Vulnerability management
  - Compliance

## Materialized Context (Merged Configuration)

### Project Information
- **Name**: Payment Gateway
- **Classification**: high
- **PCI Compliant**: True

### Testing Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 95%
- **Required Test Types**:
  - unit
  - integration
  - sast
  - dast

[... complete merged configuration ...]
```

### 3. New MCP Tool

**File**: `mcp_service/server/main.py`

Added `get_full_context_state` tool (Tool #21):
- No parameters required
- Returns formatted full context state
- Shows complete transparency into merge process

### 4. New Slash Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/show-full-context.md`

Added `/show-full-context` command that:
- Displays complete context state
- Shows all active layers
- Displays merge order
- Shows materialized configuration
- Lists active persona (if any)

### 5. Demo Script

**File**: `mcp_service/examples/full_context_state_demo.py`

Demonstrates:
1. Context without persona
2. Context with persona applied
3. Layer stack explanation

### 6. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated**:
- `PLUGIN_GUIDE.md` - Added new command to documentation
- `mcp_service/examples/validate_tools.py` - Updated to include new tool

## How It Addresses Your Model

Your conceptual model had 7 components. Here's how the full context state feature completes it:

### Component 7: Context State Command âœ… **NOW COMPLETE**

**Your Vision**: "Should give exhaustive list of materialized context for review"

**What We Built**:
- `/show-full-context` slash command
- `get_full_context_state` MCP tool
- Complete transparency into:
  - Which YAML files are loaded (layers)
  - Merge order (priority sequence)
  - Active persona overrides
  - Complete materialized configuration
  - All effective values

## Key Concepts Clarified

### Memory Merge vs File Merge

As you correctly noted:
> "the file merge is less sophisticated than the memory merge which is transparent and will be rehydrated through MCP"

The full context state feature makes this transparent:

1. **File Layer** (Simple):
   - 01_corporate_base.yml
   - 02_methodology_python.yml
   - 03_project_payment_gateway.yml

2. **Memory Merge** (Sophisticated):
   - Loads all 3 files
   - Performs deep hierarchical merge
   - Applies persona overrides (if any)
   - Results in complete materialized context

3. **MCP Rehydration**:
   - Final merged dict sent to Claude via MCP
   - Claude receives it in context/memory
   - No files written to disk
   - "Transparent" because you can now inspect it with `/show-full-context`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Load a context
/load-context payment_gateway

# View complete state
/show-full-context
```

### With Persona
```bash
# Load context and apply persona
/load-context payment_gateway
/apply-persona security_engineer

# View state showing persona layer
/show-full-context
```

### Debugging Configuration
```bash
# If unexpected values
/show-full-context

# Review:
# - Which layers are active
# - Merge order
# - Materialized values
```

## Tool Count

**Updated totals**:
- **Slash Commands**: 9
- **MCP Tools**: 21 (11 project + 5 context + 5 persona)
- **Hooks**: 4 event types
- **Personas**: 6 role types

## What This Enables

1. **Complete Visibility**: See exactly what configuration Claude is using
2. **Layer Attribution**: Know which file provided which value
3. **Merge Verification**: Confirm overrides worked correctly
4. **Persona Confirmation**: Verify persona was applied
5. **Debugging**: Diagnose configuration issues
6. **Documentation**: Generate configuration reports

## Next Steps

This completes the "context state command" vision. Potential enhancements:

1. **Layer-by-layer diff**: Show what each layer changed
2. **Value provenance**: For each value, show which layer it came from
3. **Export to file**: Save state report to markdown
4. **Comparison mode**: Compare two different contexts
5. **Timeline view**: Show context changes over time

## Summary

The full context state feature provides the "exhaustive list of materialized context for review" you requested. It makes the transparent memory merge visible and inspectable, completing your 7-component conceptual model of the context manager system.
